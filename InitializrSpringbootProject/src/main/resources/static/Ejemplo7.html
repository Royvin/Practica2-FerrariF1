            <p><strong>Nombre del nuevo carro 2024</strong>&nbsp Scuderia Ferrari's car for the coming season will be called SF-24. The team is therefore continuing the tradition of recent years which has covered almost the entire Formula 1 hybrid era. The SF naturally stands for Scuderia Ferrari, followed by the number of the current year.This formula was first used on 2015's SF15-T, the second hybrid season and the only exception since then came in 2022, when the F1-75 name celebrated the company's 75th birthday.This year's car is being launched on 13 February.</p>

            <p><strong>Scuderia Ferrari y Charles Leclerc seguiran</strong>&nbsp Scuderia Ferrari is pleased to announce that it has extended its contract with Charles Leclerc who therefore will continue to drive for the Italian team in the Formula 1 World Championship beyond the 2024 season.A product of the Academy. Charles' association with the Maranello marque goes back to before his time in Formula 1, as he joined the Ferrari Driver Academy in 2016. After a dominant performance in the 2017 Formula 2 championship, the Monegasque then spent a year learning his trade at Sauber before first racing with the Scuderia in 2019. That year he became the youngest driver in the Scuderia's history to win a Grand Prix, with a victory at the iconic Spa-Francorchamps circuit, a feat he repeated one week later in Monza in front of an ecstatic crowd. In 2022, he won a further three Grands Prix on his way to finishing second in the Drivers' standings. Known for his exceptional abilities over a qualifying lap, at just 26 years of age, he is already second in the list of drivers who have secured pole position at the wheel of a Ferrari, equal on 23 with Niki Lauda, with only the legendary Michael Schumacher ahead on 58. During his time with the Scuderia, he has taken part in 103 races, finished on the podium 30 times, set seven fastest race laps and scored 1035 points.</p>
